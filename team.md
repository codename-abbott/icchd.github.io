The Parish Team helps organize our ministries and activities, perceives the needs of the community, discusses urgent or continuous matters, keeps the contact to our mother parish/ the city church and much more.
This group of active members of the community meets every other month, thus about 5 or 6 times a year, for about 1.5 hrs, and is always happy to welcome new team members in their midst!
