###Let us love, not with words but with deeds
*This Sunday, we will celebrate the feast of Saint Elizabeth of Hungary, a 13th century princess who became a role model of charity and service to the poor. A number of charity organizations are named after her for this reason, including the Sozialzentrum Süd just next to our church. Our readings this week are chosen to reflect this special occasion. This year, her feast day also coincides with the first World Day of the Poor declared by Pope Francis.* 

The **Bishops' Conference of Germany** writes: "Come Sunday, November 19, the Catholic Church in Germany commemorates Saint Elizabeth of Hungary, who lived a life rich in self-sacrifice and devotion to the poor. Her testimony and the one of many known and unknown helpers can be a role model for us to go to the margins of our societies and be helpfully active there. We don't find these margins in our country alone, but, often in an even more dramatic form, throughout the world. The World Day of the Poor thus not only bears its name owing to the fact that Catholics worldwide will celebrate it, but also because it directs our attention beyond the borders of Germany and Europe." [*own translation*]

In his message on the first World Day of the Poor, **Pope Francis** tells us: "We may think of the poor simply as the beneficiaries of our occasional volunteer work, or of impromptu acts of generosity that appease our conscience. However good and useful such acts may be for making us sensitive to people’s needs and the injustices that are often their cause, they ought to lead to a true encounter with the poor and a sharing that becomes a way of life. Our prayer and our journey of discipleship and conversion find the confirmation of their evangelic authenticity in precisely such charity and sharing. This way of life gives rise to joy and peace of soul, because we touch with our own hands the flesh of Christ.  If we truly wish to encounter Christ, we have to touch his body in the suffering bodies of the poor, as a response to the sacramental communion bestowed in the Eucharist.  The Body of Christ, broken in the sacred liturgy, can be seen, through charity and sharing, in the faces and persons of the most vulnerable of our brothers and sisters. (...)

We are called, then, to draw near to the poor, to encounter them, to meet their gaze, to embrace them and to let them feel the warmth of love that breaks through their solitude.  Their outstretched hand is also an invitation to step out of our certainties and comforts, and to acknowledge the value of poverty in itself. (...)

I invite the whole Church, and men and women of good will everywhere, to turn their gaze on this day to all those who stretch out their hands and plead for our help and solidarity. They are our brothers and sisters, created and loved by the one Heavenly Father.  This Day is meant, above all, to encourage believers to react against a culture of discard and waste, and to embrace the culture of encounter. At the same time, everyone, independent of religious affiliation, is invited to openness and sharing with the poor through concrete signs of solidarity and fraternity. God created the heavens and the earth for all; yet sadly some have erected barriers, walls and fences, betraying the original gift meant for all humanity, with none excluded. (...)

This World Day, therefore, should become a powerful appeal to our consciences as believers, allowing us to grow in the conviction that sharing with the poor enables us to understand the deepest truth of the Gospel.  The poor are not a problem: they are a resource from which to draw as we strive to accept and practise in our lives the essence of the Gospel."
