- **Social Gathering**

  {% comment %}
  As one of our regular activities, we organize a
  get-together on a monthly basis, usually on the **first
  Sunday of the month**. (*Please check the latest bulletin*.)

  After Mass, stay around for this social gathering with
  the whole community! It is an opportunity to get to know
  new members of ICCH, to just spend time together as a
  family in faith, to share ideas and laughter... and of
  course, to enjoy food and drinks alongside. 

  **Come and join** - and if possible, bring a dish to share!
