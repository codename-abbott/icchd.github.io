Jesus began his ministry by proclaiming the message from God his Father. He told his audience that a new era is about to begin and a new relationship is being established between God and the people. He told them that the time has come which is the moment of fulfillment. The long awaited “Kingdom of God” was close at hand. That Kingdom is not a place, still less ‘heaven’, but the loving power of God, to which we are all invited to submit ourselves. It is the rule of God in the hearts of people. This Kingdom has arrived in the person of Jesus, our King and Lord. The presence of this loving power of God is evident in his teaching of the love of God, in his healing of the sick, in the liberation of people from all destructive forces in their lives, in the bringing back of the rejected and the outcast, in the forgiveness and reconciliation of sinners and finally in the supreme act of self-giving love shown in his dying for us. He invites all to enter that Kingdom through his personal call of repentance. This call is not just to feel sorry about our past; it is not just to stop the bad things we are doing now. Jesus was calling the people for a radical change in their whole way of seeing life and the world. In the words of St. Paul’s it is to be a new person for in Christ and a person has to undergo a radical personality change. Jesus then put forward the practical way of entering into the Kingdom by believing in the Gospel. Not just believing that the Gospel is true but believing in what the Gospel says and more significantly believing the person of Jesus. This involves a total commitment to the way of life presented in the Gospel and a sharing of its vision of life. This will mean standing firmly to the values of Jesus and remaining faithful to him.

Today’s Word of God demands a twofold response from people. This response is summarized in the reminder given to us on Ash Wednesday. One part of the response is a profound change in opening ourselves to the Kingdom of God and to determine the direction of our life. The other part of our response should be that we believe in the gospel, that we take Jesus at his word. In Jesus there has been a new beginning. God is once again going to re-establish his sovereignty in the world. He is going to win his victory over sin and evil. Lent as a time for repentance and we are called upon to repent and change ourselves according to the ways of Jesus. It is a time to seek the face of God and to be strengthened in our belief. At the same time Lent tells us that repentance without belief is also bad, because it can easily lead to despair. Lent is a holy season in which the Lord wants to help us repent more completely and believe more deeply. Today’s message from the Word of God clearly speaks of this triumph. The triumph of Jesus is a perfect message during the Lenten Season. It tells us that because of the triumph of Jesus by his death on the Cross, we can through him be triumphant in our battle against evil. Through our living in and with our community we learn the way of Jesus, we learn how to live in commitment to him. We learn to live a life based on truth, love, compassion, sharing, justice and freedom. We get support in living that life from the community of which we are a part. We learn to grow into a people who are whole and complete in union and harmony with our God, with others and with ourselves.

We are now entering into the great season of Lent, when we are called upon to spend six weeks preparing ourselves to celebrate the high point of our faith: the Paschal Mystery, the suffering, death and resurrection of the Incarnate God. This season is a time of penance, fasting and prayer. It is a way of purifying ourselves from our weaknesses and prepare ourselves to celebrate the passion, death and resurrection of Jesus with a renewed commitment to follow him. Even though we are no longer asked by the Church to observe the severe penances of former times, it is surely fitting that we make some of form of sacrifice as a preparation for the great event. It should be a time for personal reflection on our personal commitment as Christians. Only a little reflection will convince us that, on the one hand, there are many ways in which we fail through word and action, through our thoughts and through our failure to be the kind of people that the Gospel challenges us to be.We are called to go forward and shine by our obedience, our servitude, our charity towards others, through prayers, sacrifices, all in the love of God. Let us prepare ourselves during this season of Lent to receive the Word of God with open hearts and lead ourselves to our Lord with purified hearts and ask him to make hearts the center of his kingdom.
