The teaching Jesus offers his disciples about how hard it is for the wealthy to enter the kingdom of God is not at all comforting. The young man in todayâ€™s Gospel wanted eternal life. But he was much attached to his material possessions. He knew the commandments well and followed them faithfully and lived a good life. But he was not at all willing to sacrifice his possessions and make eternal life his primary goal. Jesus makes a figurative statement of the camel and eye of the needle, an imagery to indicate how difficult it is to a person who is attached to riches to enter into heaven. This would lead to the conclusion that the rich cannot enter into the Kingdom of heaven. This imagery needs some explanation. This may have meant the small city gate which was closed at dusk, where even the large animal like a camel would have to struggle to pass through. This was to indicate that all attachments are destructive. This would have shocked the disciples as they knew from the Old Testament that riches are a blessing and poverty is the curse. What Jesus says is that it is important to put ones trust in God and not in material possessions and he must give up his dependence on these things. Jesus demands a lot from his followers. In fact he demands everything. At the same time Jesus makes it clear that the salvation comes from God and not from any human effort or accomplishment. Jesus promises to his disciples that Salvation is something that is humanly impossible but all is possible for God. Without the grace of God, no one could be saved.

Once again we have Peter speaking on behalf of the Apostles. Perhaps here he was a little proud of himself and his companions and he reminds Jesus that they have sacrificed everything to be with him. It may not have been too much of material goods or money they had given up, yet it was all they have had and could have had. Later they gave up their lives for Jesus, the greatest offering any person could make. Christ promises them that the eternal kingdom which they will inherit will be worth a hundred times more than all they have left. He tells them as he tells us of the concrete sacrifice made by the disciple such as giving up house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands, for his sake and for the gospel. They will receive a hundredfold reward now in this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with persecutions, and in the age to come eternal life. The word persecutions are also added by Jesus as a reward. Perhaps this was added by Mark to speak of the persecutions in the early church and to explain the happiness and peace manifested by the martyrs. This shows the extraordinary way in which Jesus fills us with magnificent gifts when we have given all to God, in spirit or in reality. The Lord himself fills us with his gifts, both spiritual and temporal, including the gift of the Eucharist. Therefore if a person wishes to follow Jesus fully, he must be the center of our lives. Jesus will be of greater importance to us than family, career, or other noble ideals. Jesus today calls each one to examine self and let go anything that blocks from coming closer to him. His invitation will follow all the while and he will demand a response from everyone.

In the Divine Plan of Salvation, it is important for us to know the difference between obtaining the gift of eternal life versus the gift of salvation. Surely, eternal life alone is not what the man was asking Jesus. Having improperly expressed him as we frequently do, he asked the wrong question but got the right answer. Jesus knows the hearts of all and he knew what the man was asking, how to inherit the Kingdom of God, and thus gain salvation. The grace of God draws us to Jesus; it leads us to him in order that we might learn to know him in a perfect love. But this love of Jesus is demanding: the Christian religion is a demanding religion, a religion that asks men and women to follow Christ, renouncing themselves as well as all other creatures. In short, he who wants to be joined to the person of Jesus through the love that is of knowledge and life must renounce keeping his own life for himself: he must entrust it to God in order that God might keep it in himself eternally. This rich young man was good; Jesus wanted him to be even better. So he tells him what he has to do for his perfection is to sacrifice all he had and remain empty before God.Let us also ask our heavenly Father in the name of Jesus to respond fully to the call. May the grace of God richly shine on each and every one of us to come forward and show our attachment to him. We ask for the grace to sacrifice something personal and valuable to secure eternal life and kingdom of God.
