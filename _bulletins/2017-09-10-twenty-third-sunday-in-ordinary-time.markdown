To love of others requires a capacity to experience
another person as a person. This is not easy; we
normally see others as we see objects and things,
as facts, not as persons. We can also speak of
categories of persons, groups, classes, and even
want to speak in their name, and perhaps never
experience anyone of those abstract groups as a
personal. Love is the only adequate response of
our capacity to relate to persons, yet how difficult
we find it just to experience even one person as a
person.There is a clear duty to make oneself
responsible for others’ actions. Ezekiel warns us
that if we do not warn others of their evil ways we
will be held responsible for their spiritual death.
The Gospel advice runs in the same vein. It is not difficult to see the connection between this fraternal
correction and the Gospel precept of love for neighbor. A true love for neighbor and a true knowledge
of the nature and the harm of sin leave no other option. To love God with all one’s mind and heart
requires searching for God with all one’s mind and heart. This means the time and a readiness to search
for and know God’s presence and will. It means a whole-hearted willingness to search for God
wherever he may be found.

Today in the church Jesus places on us the painful obligation of fraternal love in the watchful love we
show towards others. To approach this painful duty of fraternal correction, it entails many qualities:
courage, compassion, patience, gentleness, humility, sincerity, reverence, a desire to preserve the
other’s good name, prudence, delicacy, tact, mutual dialogue,true listening and mercy. The readings tell
us that we will be held responsible for the silence and our unwillingness to speak. We are scandalized
and even annoyed when our leaders in the church or community do not speak. But Jesus tells us today
that we have to speak for him and rectify the wrong in the society and the community. We are there not
merely to criticize but to help positively to build bridges and rectify the wrong. This week, let us take
some time to reflect on our responsibility towards God. Let us reflect on how we will account to God
for the actions of those around us, be it our parents, our brothers or sisters, our children, our relatives,
our neighbours, our co-workers, our peers, all of those whose life we touch. Let us do what we must do
so that when we appear before God on Judgment Day, we will be able to repeat the words of Jesus,
“Not one of them was lost except the one destined to be lost.”
