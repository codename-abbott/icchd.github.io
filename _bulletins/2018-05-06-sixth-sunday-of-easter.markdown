Today’s gospel gives us two models of personal relationship to Jesus: as a servant or as a friend. At any given point in our faith journey one of these two models is dominant. Either we see our relationship to Christ mainly in terms of master-servant or in terms of friend-friend. With the exception of mystics, traditional lay spirituality in the church has usually followed the master-servant model. Jesus is seen more as a master to be feared, respected and obeyed than as a friend to love in intimacy and familiarity. Today’s gospel challenges us to rethink our relationship with Christ because, evidently, Christ himself prefers to relate with his disciples as friend to friend rather than as master to servant. He tells them at the Last Supper: “I do not call you servants any longer, because the servant does not know what the master is doing; but I have called you friends”. Jesus says that he would no longer call his disciples servants. This seems to indicate that he called them servants until then. Our relationship with Christ goes through different stages. First it starts off as a master-servant relationship when we are new to the faith, but then as our relationship with Christ deepens it changes into a less formal friend-friend type of relationship. Today’s gospel is a call for us to move beyond the infant stage, the servant-master relationship, and go over to the adult stage, the friend-friend way of relating to Christ. This will change the way we pray and the way we live and to experience more peace and joy in our lives, as people do who are in love.

While calling us to this new relationship of friendship, Jesus tells us that we all are fit to come to his level of relationship as friends. In this friendship the first choice is his as it is ours and he has found us worthy of this choice. He reminds us that we did not choose him but Jesus chose us first and he has decided to choose us in our unworthiness and to love and accept us as we are. These words of Christ, you did not choose me, but I chose you, apply to each one of us, we who believe in him, the Saviour of the world. Whether it is by our priesthood or by our baptism and our confirmation in Christ, each one of us was chosen by the Son of God to be an adoptive son of the Father in the Spirit. Each one of us has a mission to fulfil: that of spreading forth the Love of God throughout the world for the glory of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. It is God who chooses us and makes us worthy of his love which is a great privilege placed on to us. We must know that God loves us and accepts us as we are, but God loves us too much to leave us as we are. We love babies as they are, yet we want them to grow up. God expects us, similarly, to grow in his love. The Lord’s offer to us of friendship and intimacy with him should not be an excuse for callousness and indifference. Just as God showed his love for us in deed by sending his Son to die for us, so is true love for God always shown in deed by the way we keep the twin commandments of love of God and neighbour.

This demand he makes of us to tell us that if we are truly the friends of Jesus we must do as he commands us to do. That is the close bond of friendship relationship.
In his friendship towards us Jesus has made known to us everything that He has heard from the Father. Through the revelation that was made complete in Jesus, God gave endlessly to us. Jesus goes further to tell us that it has been his initiative to choose his disciples. We did not choose Jesus. He chose us. We do not have the capability of drawing towards God. It is by the grace of the Father that we are drawn to Jesus. It is God the Father calling us, telling us through His Spirit, “Jesus is the answer. Go to Him.” God created us to love; He created us so that we might all love each other with only one heart, one soul. God created us so that, one day, we might receive within us his Son Jesus, and, through Him, all the Love he is in person as God, the Son and Image of the Father. Later in his discourse Jesus thanks the Father for choosing the disciples and giving them to him to be with him. There is no contradiction here because of the mutuality of the relationship, for Jesus and the Father are one. This choice is made through the power of the Holy Spirit and therefore we are being transformed in the likeness of Christ. Through the power of love, we are being made holy so we may shine towards others in the fruit of the Holy Spirit.
