One day the disciples saw Jesus praying. When he had finished, one of them asked him: Lord, teach us to pray. Jesus follows this request and entrusts the disciples with five petitions - five petitions that could not be more unexpected. Who would think of talking to God like that?
When you pray, say: Father, let your name be hallowed. Without introduction, without prior apology for harassment, Christians may address God as their "Father". God, the Holy One, the wholly Other than themselves. But this means that with the first word with which Jesus teaches his own to pray, he takes them into his own relationship with God - into a community of trust that is disguised by nothing and that alone, through the peace of heart that it gives, constitutes the whole happiness of a human soul: Abba, dear Father, who created me and who now carries me.
And then the first petition. Only those who have no purpose or intention in their prayers can make this request. He who can speak in this way is happy that God wants to be his Father: 'May your name be hallowed’.
This means: To you, to your name, that is, to the Father's name, be given the honour. Because you are there for us, as this name says, you shall first of all be praised and thanks shall be given to you. Let all the world know you and sing to you.
Because you are our good Father, your praise can be more important to us than the most urgent requests. For we are certain that our requests and our prayers for our lives to turn out well - that these requests and their answers are already taken care of in your Fatherhood. Certainly sometimes differently than we ourselves wish or hope and imagine. But they are irrevocably and unforgettably preserved in your sympathy for us.

The second petition - Thy kingdom come - is, as it were, a self-evident addendum to the first. It wants this undisturbed relationship of trust between God and Jesus, and then through Jesus between God and Christians, to spread throughout the world. Every time we pray the Our Father, we pray that every person may be given the opportunity to share in the happiness of this security.

Again, the lack of intention, because no one asks for something for himself alone, but thinks of the others, because he knows that he has already been given something by being able to say "Father" to God.

All the more surprising, of course, must be the third request that Jesus teaches us: Give us daily the bread we need. In the midst of spiritual thoughts about God and his kingdom, there is suddenly talk of food. And this is no coincidence, but an intense, even unmistakable indication of the humanity of the Gospel.
We are not angelic spiritual beings who live only from pious thoughts and Hallelujah singing. In addition to the soul, we also have a body that demands its rights and needs more than air and love: namely bread. This humanity of the Gospel is echoed in the highest form of Christian worship. Exactly at the point of completion of the prayer of thanksgiving of the Eucharist as the expression of our devotion to God, there is food for the thankful person. Even if it is only the small slice of the host, a piece of bread for our eyes, we experience God's care for our bodies as well. In the bread prayer of the Lord's Prayer, Christians thus also entrust the needs of their sensuality to the heavenly Father: Give us daily the bread we need. The request, mind you, is twofold: give us the bread we need - that is, not less, but also not more than is good for us. The Lord knows about our fear-generated temptation to need or simply hoard more bread than we really need to live. And this always happens because others have less than they need. Thus Jesus' request for bread, regardless of our needs, teaches us again that lack of intention which is needed so that we ourselves do not become hard and unloving and unjust towards one another.
After the request for bread comes the request for forgiveness of sins. You may be familiar with Brecht's bitterly wicked, yet undeniable saying that first comes food and then comes morality. Only a person who no longer wants or needs to take care of his survival first can develop a fine sense for where he owes God something - and usually a lot. And he can ask for forgiveness. Of course, only those who are prepared to forgive those who are guilty of their own fault can judge the immense weight of what this request hopes for. It takes the human practice of forgiveness for one to be able to honestly ask God for forgiveness: Forgive us our sins, for - for we too forgive everyone what they owe us. Of course, this is also possible: through the promise in the confession that God forgives us our sins, the strength can grow to also forgive our neighbour what he owes us.

And finally: lead us not into temptation! Our life is sometimes so complicated, so inscrutable; it seems so incomprehensibly hard that we even want to lose our faith - and with it the treasure of being able to say Father to God and to know that we are entrusted body and soul to God's caring love. Save us from this! We do not have to fear hell and fight for paradise with all our strength as long as you, God, dear Father, let us see your traces.
As long as we can at least sense them in the to and fro of our days, which are so full of enquiries, temptations, trials, decisions. Let us take your name - Father - so seriously that we cling to it even when we feel completely abandoned in the quicksand of the days of our lives. This begs the petition to be preserved from temptation.

God, the good Father, in the beginning and in the end. His name is the soul of the Lord's Prayer. And now we can also understand from where Jesus, in the two parables of the friend who asks for bread and of the father who would never give his son a snake instead of the fish he asked for, draws his incontrovertible certainty that God will answer his and our prayer of the Lord's Prayer without fail. He will hear it, because he who prays in this way gives himself completely to God, body and soul.

Those who pray in this way trust that the one who is truly called Abba, dear Father, never wishes us ill, even when our supplication seems unanswered.

Every prayer that follows the basic pattern of the Lord's Prayer may be answered. No, it is answered. You can check for yourself that this is true: From time to time, compare what has happened to you with what you have prayed for. And if there is a difference between the two, then think about how you should have prayed so that your prayer would have matched what happened to you. It will always be a prayer close to the Lord's Prayer. That is why we need to rehearse the Lord's Prayer today and every Sunday and pray it every day.
