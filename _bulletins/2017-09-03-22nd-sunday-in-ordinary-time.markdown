***Whoever wishes to come after me must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me***

In contemporary society where “self-realization” is encouraged and glorified, Jesus’ teaching of “self-denial” is a real challenge. Some may ask: Is denying oneself not losing oneself? What remains if one denies oneself? Is taking up the cross really necessary? Are there no other effective ways of being disciples of Jesus? But Jesus’ words are so clear. He warns sharply against the danger of losing what is most precious for immediate gain. Should we not understand the perplexing word “to deny oneself” as meaning to give the priority to God’s will and plan instead of our own?

This teaching of Jesus follows Peter’s declaration in Caesarea Philippi. Jesus admires Peter’s faith and rewards him with the promise of the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Paradoxically, however, from that time on he begins to announce his passion. When Peter opposes it, he scolds him harshly for setting his mind “not on divine things but on human things” (16:23). For Christ there is a divine imperative one must obey, even though one may not fully understand it. He lived it out till the very end and invites his disciples to do the same. That is what it means to lose one’s life for his sake.

Far from being a form of blackmail, these words are a promise of life to everyone who has decided to follow Christ by giving their life in various forms in the Church. Those who forget themselves for the sake of Christ and Gospel in the service of others will receive a hundred times more! Freed from worry and fear for the future, they will be able to live the present moment more intensively with trust in God, knowing that their past is buried in Christ and that He will take care of their future. Finding a true meaning of their life in the service of God and neighbors, hence finding inner joy and peace—that is what it means to find life.
