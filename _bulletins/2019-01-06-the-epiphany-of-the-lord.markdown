## Gospel reflection

“Where is the newborn king of the Jews? We saw his star at its rising and have come to do him homage.”  All they had was a star.  It was enough. We don’t know much about these scientists who studied the stars, only as persons from another part of the world, who told us they had come on a search. Everything about them was foreign… except, like us, they had a knowledge, some resources, and were confidently acting on their beliefs. They expected to find this child. Humankind has a long history of living with dreams and promises. Deep in our hearts, we yearn … for peace and security, for freedom and connection… personally and for all humanity.

We are a community of believers, People of God’s Promise ever new in each generation.  “May your Light come….and shine upon us”, we pray. The birth of Jesus reveals how God came to live among us in our world. We share this vision in faith, on which we choose to act every day in hope. We entrust ourselves and our world to the One who made us, who thoroughly knows us and unconditionally loves us.

We don’t know the particular faith of these Wise Seekers, who followed a star, believing in a promise. They only had this sign in front of them. It was enough to motivate and to guide them. Humanly, we understand that all we need is one star - a person, a possibility that catches our attention, pulls at our heart and encourages us to take the next steps. And we, as we live and work, read the daily news, can we touch the longings and urgings of our own hearts for ourselves, for our families, our communities, our nation, our world?

Toward the end, still paying attention, these wise persons changed their route once again as they departed. We never learn the rest of their story; but, we do know their example. Over and over again, moment by moment across our lifetimes, God comes to us where we live, as we are. In these moments of discovering that God is really here, our hearts too, will be overjoyed.

As we come to the new year, may we know your never-ending presence more deeply and see your goodness shining all around.
