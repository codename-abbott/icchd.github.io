In the Gospel passage we have the words of Jesus telling Nicodemus, that just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoever believes in him may have eternal life. In this Biblical passage, Jesus was referring to an event that occurred in the days of the Old Testament.In the days of Moses, the people of God had lost their patience and spoke against God and Moses and constantly complained against them. They asked why they were brought out of the land of Egypt to die in the wilderness. They grumbled that there was no food or water, and they detested the miserable food they got namely the Mannah. To punish the ungrateful people for having spoken against him, God sent poisonous snakes. Many Israelites were bitten by the snakes and died. When the people repented and acknowledged that they had wrongly spoken again the Lord God and Moses, they asked Moses to pray to the Lord to take away the poisonous serpents. Following this, God instructed Moses to make a metal snake and to put it on a pole so that anyone who was bitten could look at it. Whoever would look at the figure of the serpent would not die from the snake bite. This event was prophetic in nature. It represented what was to come in the days of the ministry of Jesus on earth. John applies this action of Moses in the desert to Jesus being lifted up on the cross. The metal snake was an image of Christ was a sign and symbol of God. As the metal snake was raised and put on the pole, Jesus was also raised and nailed to the Holy Cross. It is God’s saving action for humanity.

Jesus used the story as a parable of himself. He told Nicodemus that for the salvation of the world he himself would be lifted up. He meant this in a twofold sense: lifted up on the cross and lifted up into glory by his resurrection and his ascension. The suffering and joy signified by these two images are essentially connected. If there is no cross then there is no crown of joy and if there is no pain and suffering then no entry into glory. Jesus tells us today as he told his visitor that if we look at Jesus and believe in him then he will give us eternal life. The eternal life that Jesus gives us is not the duration of life but the quality of life. That is the highest life possible which is life with God himself living in us. It surrounds us and infuses every aspect of our life with peace, peace with people because we are God’s children, peace with life itself because we live in a friendly universe and peace with ourselves because of a new insight into and humble acceptance of our weaknesses. Jesus sums this up by saying that God so loved the world that he gave his only Son for us human persons. His whole essence is love and he loves the entire world itself.

It is important to know that for John the crucifixion of Jesus is his exaltation. That is why the crucifixion is the high point of the Gospel. In fact for John crucifixion, resurrection and ascension are all one continuous act. There is also a parabolic reversal in all this: what appears to be the greatest humiliation of Jesus, his crucifixion, is in fact his greatest glory, his exaltation. The whole purpose of Jesus being lifted up on the cross is to demonstrate that those who believe in him might have eternal life. By the phrase eternal life John does not mean the endless endurance of human existence. Eternal life is life lived in the unending presence of God. One does not have to wait until some unknown future to have this desired life. It can begin in the here and now for those who have faith in Jesus. This life is defined by God and not by humans. St Augustine tells us that God loves each one of us as if there was only one of us to love. That shows the depth of his love for humanity.

In the next passage of the Gospel Jesus summarizes the saving action of God in the incarnation and the motivation for that action. Jesus says that God did not send the Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Those who believe in him are not condemned; but those who do not believe are condemned already, because they have not believed in the name of the only Son of God. The passage tells us what is known as the most profound summary of God’s love that God loved the world so much that he gave his only son for our sake that we may have life in him. It is personal and most profound gift because it is God’s Son who is given to the world. This gift in effect begins God’s judgment of the world. However, that judgment will be the result of the choices made by the people. Those who accept and believe in Jesus will be saved and those who do not will perish. John portrays Jesus as the light that came into darkness. It is not a loving God who condemns; rather people choose to alienate themselves from his love. John says that all those who do wrong deliberately hate the light and choose darkness. A person who lives by truth and integrity is not afraid of the light. Such a person has nothing to hide, nothing to be ashamed of. Some people condemn themselves by turning away from the light. However it is still the people who must choose to live in the light or to remain in darkness. Jesus is the Light. He is the only way. He is the only Truth. He is the only Life. There are none other but Jesus who can save us by the grace of the Heavenly Father and the power of the Holy Spirit. All of this is a matter of faith. Through our living faith in Christ, we have the assurance of salvation.
