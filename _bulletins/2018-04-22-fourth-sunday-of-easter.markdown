Jesus uses the imagery of the shepherd from the ordinary usage of life and calls himself the Good Shepherd. During the time of Jesus the shepherd of the Middle East had close intimate relationship with a smaller flock. The Shepherd was in charge of them and would lead them out to pasture daily while spending all his time with them. He took personal care of them and Jesus says that he had a deep sense of commitment and responsibility towards his own sheep. He was concerned about the sheep and hence they had the attraction towards him. Every good shepherd knew every one of his sheep by name and he was aware that his sheep also knew him. This showed the intimate knowledge of the shepherd. There was the mutual understanding, a bond of love and intimacy between them and the sheep acknowledged its shepherd. When they were lost he went in search of them and carried them on his shoulders and brought them to the flock. The image of Christ as a good shepherd has always appealed human nature. One of the earliest paintings of Christ in the Roman catacombs represents him as carrying an injured sheep on his shoulders. This is a manifestation of love which touches our innermost feelings. Finally a good shepherd risked his life to protect his sheep from all dangers. In the same way we have a God who is ready to die for his people and Jesus emphasizes that his death was the living proof of his sacrificing for the sake of those he loved. This is the proof that Jesus truly is a Good Shepherd.

As we celebrate Good Shepherd Sunday, let us ask the Lord that we may be his good sheep, listening attentively to his voice, and follow his example of self-giving love. Jesus gives us the example of a good shepherd who shows his concern and care for his own sheep. The Lord of compassion promises to go and gather his sheep and bring them back to good pasture. This is the time we pray for all our shepherds in the church and society who are given the responsibility of caring for others. Here we have Jesus as our model and who offered to sacrifice his life for his chosen ones. Jesus the Good Shepherd is the Way, the Truth and the Life. He is the one who goes after the lost sheep leaving the ninety-nine to bring it back to the fold. This Sunday, also the Vocation Sunday we are asked to pray for many and good vocations to continue the work of the Shepherd. The church insists that vocations are a responsibility of the Christian family. To foster vocations, the family must foster the Christian life. The family must live its faith in Christ on a daily basis in unity and prayer. The Church of Jesus fosters a living faith in our community, leading us to the Father through Jesus. Here the grace of God is manifested which will help vocations to flourish to ensure that the needs of the Church are all met. Today let us pray for vocations to the priesthood and religious life, that many will be inspired to show true love, to the point of sacrificing many other attractive options to become priests of Jesus, to follow him in religious life.
