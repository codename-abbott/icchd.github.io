The gospels that we are hearing and reading during Easter tell us about the people who met the risen Jesus. In many ways these are very ordinary people in equally ordinary situations.

Mary Magdalene met Jesus at the tomb and thought he was the gardener. On one occasion, Jesus met his friends while they were fishing and he cooked breakfast for them on the beach! In todays gospel, Jesus appears to two disciples while they are walking away from Jerusalem towards Emmaus.

They are walking away from the place of disaster and disappointment.

These two are leaving Jerusalem after they saw Jesus being betrayed, denied, condemned and crucified. They saw him die and being buried. We can only imagine their despair, disappointment and disorientation. When these two meet Jesus, he simply asks them what they are talking about.

He wants to know what has happened and what is happening to them. They tell him all the things they had seen and experienced. As they speak to Jesus, he walks with them and listens to them. He becomes their companion on the journey.

He does not walk behind or in front of them; he walks by their side. Difficult as these days are for all of us, we are being called and invited to truly believe that the Risen Jesus is walking with us and listening to as we tell him all the things that are happening to us. In your prayer and conversation with Jesus, what are you telling him today?

Towards the end of the gospel, Jesus was going to carry on walking, but they asked him stay with him for a meal. He waited to be asked to stay. Perhaps today as individuals and as families, we too can ask Jesus to stay with us. If we ask him, he will not refuse us. We are not alone â€“ the Risen Lord is with us; walking with us and listening to us.

Jesus Christ, you travelled through towns and villages curing every disease and sickness. At your word those who were sick were made well again. Come now to our aid in the midst of the global spread of the Coronavirus, that we may experience your healing love.

Jesus Christ, healer of all, walk with us and stay with us during this time of uncertainty and bring us your peace. Amen.
