**Fear and Forgiveness**

The fearful Gospel Reading says that there is an
unforgivable sin. What is that?

To see the answer, consider [today's Psalm 130]: _out of
the depths I cry to you, O Lord! If you, O LORD, mark
iniquities, LORD, who can stand?_ Who doesn’t feel this
way about his sins?

And now notice how the Psalm continues: _But with you
is forgiveness, that you may be revered_ — or, as
another translation has it, _that you may be feared_.
Why think that God forgives your sins so that you
might revere or fear him? Wouldn't it be more true to
say that you fear God because you worry about your
sins? Wouldn’t you fear that if you faced God, your sins
would just seem worse because you would see them in
the light of God’s holiness?

And yet look what the Psalm says: there is forgiveness with God! God's forgiveness can gentle you into a
surrender to God’s love, can’t it? If God himself loves you and forgives your sins, then wouldn’t you love God and
want to cleave to him? And so the Psalmist is right: there is forgiveness of your sins with God so that you might
fear God - not with a fear of God’s punishing or forsaking you, but just with a fear of your own turning away from
the Lord who forgives you.

But, then, if God forgives you so that you might fear him, what sin of yours is unforgivable?

You can see the answer for yourself now, can't you?

What happens if when God forgives you, you turn away from him instead of cleaving to him and fearing him? If
you turn away from God even when God forgives you, then there is nothing left that God can do for you, is there?
The gift of God’s forgiveness is there for you. But if you won’t open to receive it, then even God can’t give it.

And what does a refusal to accept God’s forgiveness come to except a refusal to believe that the love and
forgiveness of God are there, there for you too? In effect, a refusal of God’s forgiveness is a rejection of God as
love.

And so the unforgivable sin is a permanent refusal to accept God’s forgiveness. But that refusal really is
blasphemous against the Spirit of God, isn’t it? What does Scripture say? God is Love.
