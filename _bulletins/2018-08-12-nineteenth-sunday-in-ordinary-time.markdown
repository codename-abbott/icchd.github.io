In the Gospel of today Jesus goes on to foretell the Eucharist. Jesus tells the people that he is the bread of life and is going to be the food of the believers. Here the reality of the mystery is presented fewer than two different aspects. The first aspect consists in saying that this food is the Body of Christ; the second aspect, that the Body of Jesus is this food. Those who believe in the teachings of Jesus, who persevere in their living faith, and who receive the Church Sacraments, they are on their way to eternal life in the Kingdom of God. Jesus promises that those who believe in him will be fed by the spiritual food which is his own body and blood. The Jews with their religious beliefs found it hard and could not accept the claims of Jesus that he was more than a Prophet. The Eucharist that he gives us is the sacrificial meal which he offered on the cross for our sake and for the sake of humanity which is an offering and the same time a gift. Today we ask the grace from Jesus that our Eucharistic celebrations may become truly an experience which helps us to be transformed into a community of love. We need to become a people reaching out in love to all those in need around us. We ourselves, as living members of the Body of Christ, must ourselves become life-giving Bread for others. Our Eucharist, then, becomes first a celebration of what we are a loving people and secondly become a force in our lives to love even more. Just as prophet Elijah went for 40 days and 40 nights on the strength of the bread God gave him, we too may travel on our life’s journey with the strength of the Eucharist.

The Temple was built on an island and it held a thousand bells big and small fashioned by the finest craftsmen in the world. When the wind blew of a storm raged, all the bells would peal out in a symphony that would send the heart of the hearer into raptures. But over the centuries the island sank into the sea and, with it, the temple bells. An ancient legend said that the bells continued to peal out, ceaselessly, and could be heard by anyone who would listen. Inspired by this legend, a young man traveled thousands of miles, determined to hear those bells. He sat for days on the shore, facing the vanished island, and listened with all his might. But all he could hear was the sound of the sea. He made every effort to block it out but without success. He kept at his task for weeks. Each time he got disheartened he would listen to the village people who spoke with unction of the mysterious legend. Then his heart would be aflame… only to become discouraged again when weeks of further effort yielded no results. Finally he decided to give up the attempt. Perhaps he was not destined to hear the bells. Perhaps the legend was not true. It was his final day, and he went to the shore to say goodbye to the sea and the sky and the wind and all the trees. He lay on the sand, and for the first time, listened to the sound of the sea. Soon he was so lost in the sound that he was barely conscious of himself, so deep was the silence that the sound produced. In the depth of that silence, he heard it: the tinkle of a tiny bell followed by another, and another, and another. And soon every one of the thousand temple bells was pealing out in harmony, and his heart was filled with joyous ecstasy.
