Today’s gospel repeats ideals that were already clear in the Old Testament. The command to “Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength and with all your mind,” was imprinted on the heart of every Jew, as their central daily prayer. This prayer is the Shema, since the Hebrew “Shema” means “Listen.” “Listen Israel, the Lord our God is the one Lord”. What is special about today’s Gospel is where it says that love of God is inextricably interwoven with love for each other. Any claim to love God is illusory if it it does not result in loving other people, reaching out to embrace them as God does.

A Jewish Rabbi named Hillel was a renowned scholar, a spiritual and ethical leader of his generation, with a great following around the time of Jesus. When Hillel asked, “Which is the greatest commandment?” he gave the famous reply, “What you hate for yourself, do not do to your neighbour. This is the whole law; the rest is commentary.” Jesus also links love of God with love of neighbour, to jointly form the greatest commandment. According to St Augustine we should “Love God first, and then do what you will,” meaning that if we love God properly, we cannot but want others to share in that love. The fourth evangelist, John, saw everything in Christ’s life on earth in terms of love, and kept preaching this into his old age. He even declares that “Anyone who says, ‘I love God,’ and hates his brother, is a liar, for how can one who does not love the brother that he can see, love God whom he has never seen?” (1 Jn 4:20).

Loving with all of one’s heart is a truly radical challenge, in imitation of Christ. But it is our Christian vocation. For we believe that life comes from death, that gain comes from loss, that receiving comes from giving, and that Jesus himself had to die to come to the fullness of life. We profess to be followers of one who made a complete offering of himself to the Father and spent his energies and his time in the service of others, who returned to his Father devoid of any earthly goods.

This does not imply that we have to tread exactly the same path as Christ. What it does indicate is that genuine surrender to God does not allow us to retreat into a paradise of unreal spirituality. It means that if we love God, we need to be concerned for others, for the members of our family and community. We need to rise above our selfishness and realise that “there is greater happiness in giving than in receiving” (Acts 20:35).

“The world is too much with us,” wrote William Wordsworth, “late and soon / getting and spending, we lay waste our powers.” We pass this way but once, and while we are on this journey we need to do as much good as we can with our God-given powers, for serving God and others. Always we need to keep in mind the promise of Jesus (Jn 15:5), “Whoever remains in me, with me in him, bears fruit in plenty.”
