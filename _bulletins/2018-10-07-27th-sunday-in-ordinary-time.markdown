***If we love one another, 
God remains in us
and his love is brought to perfection in us.***

(*verse from the Gospel acclamation*)

How often have we heard it said, “It’s all about relationships.”

Today’s First Reading from Genesis is just that: ‘all about relationships.’

Being alone, unconnected or disconnected tears at the heart of a God who creates for us fitting companions along life’s journey. 

The reading begins with the wonder and beauty of creation, the natural world where things are called by name and graced with a dignity and integrity all their own.  The human’s relationship to nature was to be filled with reverence, respect and awe at the rhythms of the seasons and of the patterns in the animal world.

In the second part of the reading, the importance of fulfilling relationships is illustrated when God creates human companions to nourish and sustain one another.  These companions can be women, men, children, family members, life partners, spouses, neighbors, and co-workers.  It is with these that we share a bond forged from honesty, loyalty, respect and faithfulness over time.  These qualities make for ‘right relationships.’

Woven into the tapestry of all relationships is the love that holds it all together.  We have very few definitions of who God/the Holy One is, but one that does stand out in that ‘God is Love.” If love permeates our relationships with our companions along life’s journey, than we believe that we are joined in love and joined in God; this love, this connection is the reason for which we have been fashioned.
