*As Jesus passed on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the customs post. He said to him, “Follow me.” And he got up and followed him.* (Mt 9:9)

Matthew would have been a very unpopular person. He would have either been a private contractor of the Roman government or a tax collector of Herod Antipas, the Jewish leader of Galilee. Either way, tax collectors were disliked because it was common knowledge that they often extorted more than permitted and pocketed some of the money. Essentially, they were seen as thieves who stole from the people with the permission of the civil rulers.

Matthew would have also been somewhat wealthy, at least wealthier than most. So when Jesus walked up to him and said to him, “Follow me,” this would have caught the attention of many. And when Matthew got up, left his customs post and followed Jesus, the people watching would have been surprised, to say the least.

What was it that inspired Matthew to leave his former life behind, his wealth and position of power, and follow this humble man from Nazareth? It was the simple fact that this man was also the Son of God.

Though we do not know the internal stirrings of Matthew’s soul, we certainly can speculate. Most likely, Matthew had discovered that his tax collecting was dissatisfying. Yes, he had money and power. Yes, he could buy material comforts with that money. But most likely he was dissatisfied with life and was searching for more. As a result, he was open, searching and waiting. Then, when Jesus called to him, this call went further than his ears. It entered his soul, and somehow he knew that Jesus’ call was what he was looking for.

We can presume this to be the case because it is a law of human nature that applies to each and every person. No one will find deep peace and satisfaction in life from the material things of this world. Though they may offer a certain amount of comfort, the things of this world are incapable of fulfilling anyone in the truest way. Fulfillment is first and foremost a spiritual reality because we are spiritual beings. And the only way to find satisfaction on that level is by hearing and responding to the will of God. That’s what Matthew did.

Reflect, today, upon this scene of Matthew being called by Jesus and leaving everything behind to follow him. If you were there and knew Matthew, what would your interior response be? Would you have been surprised that he left his money and position to become a humble follower of Jesus? Would you have been critical of him, laughed at him or ridiculed him? Or would you have been grateful that Matthew finally found the truth? Matthew’s discovery is a discovery that is also offered to you. God is calling you to follow Him more fully every day. As you hear this call, do not hesitate to leave every hindrance behind so that you can fully follow the plan God has for you.

*Lord, You and You alone are the source of all satisfaction and fulfillment in life. You are glorious beyond description and worth following always. Please free me from the many deceptive satisfactions in life so that I can follow You, no matter where You lead. Jesus, I trust in You.*
