***"Many are invited, but few are chosen." (Mt 22:14)***

We pray with the grace which God offers constantly. We are called, invited and preparing to sit once more at the Table of Abundance. We are attired in the inner garment of Baptism and the outer wear of the good things which are a reflection of who we know ourselves to be. We are not invited and seated because we have done these good things, but because of the goodness of the Invitor. Those good deeds are not tickets, but little sacraments or out-doings of our identities.

We can pray with our sense of being in a community of those whom God has called to be seated with us and whose wonderful works might not be celebrated on the evening news, but are constructive to God's "vineyard" here on earth.

We pray also with the grace of belief. We pray with the grace of confidence in the Caller and Comforter. We are encouraged in our belief by the presence of those who are also seated at the Table waiting to be fed and sent once more.

**Reflection:**

In the First Reading from the prophet Isaiah, we hear a foretelling of the times of the coming Messiah. This section has to do with a kind of banquet with fine wine. There is a spirit of coming joy, clarity of vision as well as a recognition that the hand of God is a blessing and renewing hand. All peoples, all nations have suffered from a dim view of God's presence and actions, but on "that" day and on "that" mountain, a new "way", a new revelation will enlighten and inspire.

The Gospel continues the theme of last few weeks' parables. (...) There is the theme of invitation again and a refusal to respond. As with the previous parables, the "tax collectors and prostitutes" are now the responders and entering the kingdom or banquet as well. The parable is again an allegory in which symbolic figures represent exact persons or groups. There is the king and his son. There are the invited who refuse and the servants who go out beyond where the usual invitees stand. There are the newly included who seem to respond quickly. There is also the strange encounter between the king and the one person who is not properly dressed who gets tossed out into a confusing place of alienation and regret.

Jesus has come as the center of the feast and the one doing the inviting for his father. All are called, but called to be dressed in the outwardness, the mission-side, and the doing-of-good deeds into which we are chosen through Baptism. Love is manifested in deeds and not merely desires or words. The new city, the ever-present "mountain" is Jesus and his embrace of us all. Please be extremely careful these days not to interpret this parable and others in such a way that excludes our Jewish brothers and sisters from inhabiting the "mountain" and as being excluded from the embrace and feast. Our Jesuit community can only invite so many because our house is small. The "mountain", the "vineyard" of Jesus is still infinite.
