The Readings for today continue the theme of Choices and Values, but with a certain twist. Our 
choices must be based on faith, with the ultimate goal being our salvation. Today, we hear 
about God's Plan of Salvation, the divine plan for all mankind. You see, God did not create 
mankind and then leave us to ourselves. His goal was, and still is, to bring us back to the Father 
at the time of death and then collectively at the end of time when He will honor all mankind 
according to what we have accomplished here on earth. So, let us see how the readings fit into 
this picture.    
The First Reading is from the Book of Wisdom (18:6-9). This passage is a reflection on the 
events of the first Passover, the liberation of the Israelites from Egypt during the time of Moses. 
It is the primary event in the history of the Jews, who were the first to accept God directing their 
lives in order to set in motion the expanded works of His Plan. This is the meaning of the last 
line of this passage: "...putting into effect with one accord the divine institution (plan)."    
The Responsorial Psalm is (33:1, 12, 18-22). It is a meditation on the events mentioned above. 
Here the psalmist praises God and takes pride in the fact that he is part of "the people He (God) 
has chosen for his own inheritance." The last two sentences of this portion of the Psalm reflect 
on those who have chosen the spiritual values that are in line with God's Plan for them.    
The Second Reading is from the Letter to the Hebrews (11:1-2, 8-19). In this section of 
Hebrews, the author is explaining the many characters that were instrumental in affecting God's 
Plan of Salvation among the Jews. Here, he mentions Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, Patriarchs of 
ancient Judaism, whose faith in God overcame many obstacles and tests to accomplish their part 
of God's Plan even though "they did not receive what had been promised but saw it and 
greeted it from afar." Today, we might not see what God has in mind for us; but if we are faithful 
to Him, we will eventually see and enjoy it.   
The Gospel Reading is from the Gospel of St. Luke (12:32-48). This passage is a continuation 
from last week. In it, Jesus is again explaining that the choices and values we live by will 
determine our place in the Kingdom. Although Jesus is speaking in terms and ways that were 
easily understood by the people of His time, His instructions and advice are just as applicable to 
us today. We should be able to translate this “word picture” into the language of today for our 
understanding; but the result will be the same.    
As we said last week, God wants us to enjoy life and the things that He created for us; however, 
these must be in accord with our faith and with his Plan of Salvation for us. We do much to 
educate ourselves and our children to face the world and its many complexities, so why is it that 
we don't spend time in trying to better understand what God wants from each of us? Something 
to think about during your prayer time this week!
