According to the Gospel of John, Jesus now promises [the disciples] that the Father will send them the Spirit, the Advocate or Paraclete in the name of Jesus for the specific purpose of reminding the disciples what Jesus had taught them. […]

The Gospel of today tells us of the Christian unity in those who obeyed the command of Jesus. This is directly applicable to the disciples as it is applied to us today. Jesus explains to them that those who love him sincerely will keep his word, and the Father of Jesus will love them, and they will come to them and make their home within them.” […] Those who love Jesus, they are of one spiritual mind with the others who also obey the command of the Lord. If we only had those words from Jesus and nothing else, they would be enough to guide every Christian through life and point them in the right direction. United in one Faith in the Lord Jesus, the Disciples of Christ are gathered here to adore and worship our Lord, our God. In the Catholic spirit, we are united to receive the blessings that are bestowed upon those who receive the Sacrament of the Holy Eucharist that is the Living Bread. For Jesus, love, by which he means loving, is achieved by “keeping his word”. The “word” of Jesus must not be limited to what we were taught as “commandments” or “doctrines” or moral behaviour, but embraces everything we know about him through the Scripture – his words, his actions, his relationships with people of all kinds, the guiding principles of his life, his values and attitudes. […]

Jesus promised us the Paraclete, the third person of the Godhead, to help give God’s peace to us. The word Paraclete is also translated as Advocate and is explained as comforter. But the Paraclete does more than to comfort. He is the mediator, defence attorney, the one who stands by us in time of need. When in difficulty he is always there with us to support guide and help. What the lawyer does for pay, the Paraclete does for love. As the Jesuit poet Hopkins said, the Paraclete is the one who cheers, who encourages, who persuades, who exhorts, who stirs up, who urges forward, and who calls on. A Paraclete is zealous that we should do the good and leads us with assurance and strength, encouraging us and guiding every step we take. […]

We ask the grace that we may be true to him and faithful in our response to the calling of the Spirit. Jesus wants us to have his peace and share it with others. But before we share with others we ourselves must enjoy this peace. He wants us to remember that if we are ill at ease in ourselves we cannot obtain his peace. Thomas Merton says: “If you are yourself at peace, then there is at least some peace in the world.” Again Jesus calls us to be the path-finders in the world of today as in the early church and wants us to be light bearers in the world. We have the Holy Spirit to inspire us and guide us and he will show us the necessary path particularly in these days of storms and struggles. Founded on the faith of the Apostles, the Christians of every age, like you and me, are called by the Holy Spirit to put their faith in the words of the Lord. Then, the Father will come, and Jesus with him: all will be but one in God and the Peace of the Lord will reign everywhere.
