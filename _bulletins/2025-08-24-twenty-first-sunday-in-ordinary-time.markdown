###Heaven’s Gate

Maybe you remember the parable which Jesus told two weeks ago. There was a man knocking on a friend’s door at midnight, wanting to borrow some bread. The friend yelled back,

*do not bother me; the door has already been locked and my children and I are already in bed. I cannot get up to give you anything.*

Jesus responds:

*I tell you, if he does not get up to give him the loaves because of their friendship, he will get up to give him whatever he needs because of his persistence. I tell you, ask and you will receive; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.*

Doesn’t it feel good knowing that constant prayer will get the door opened? 

Well, hold that feeling back for a while and look at this Sunday’s Gospel. Here again someone is knocking on the door late at night. But they receive nothing. The master of the house says,

*I do not know where you are from. The one(s) knocking replies: “but we ate and drank in your company and you taught in our streets.”*

Look carefully at those words: clearly, the askers have to be mere casual acquaintances, if that. Something like this: we liked what you did, and now we want more!

The master says,

*I do not know where you are from.
Depart from me, all you evildoers!*

Ouch. What about “ask and you shall receive”? As if to rub it in, Jesus says,

*There will be wailing and grinding of teeth
    when you see the saved ones—
    Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets—
    looking down from heaven
    while you are being cast out!*

What is going on here? Is Jesus just in a bad mood? We know that he is “making his way to Jerusalem” as he tells this parable, walking straight into the crucifixion, so maybe he is just anxious.

Yet notice that, in last week’s parable, even though the owner opens the door just to get the noise stopped, the interruption was being caused by a friend—albeit a rude one—who would not stop asking for what he needed. That parable told us to keep asking God, our friend, for what we need, even though he may be a bit grumpy.

But, in the parable for this Sunday, the people outside are obviously not friends and in fact they have no relationship at all to the master of the house. This parable states that they knew about him only from parties and from the streets. They heard him preaching but they did nothing. They did not come to his house at a reasonable hour and begin a friendship.

No amount of midnight knocking will make up for it.

What is our lesson? That God keeps the door open long beyond what anyone would expect, all the way to the end. But if we are too busy partying and dancing, then finally there is nothing he can do. He has to accept our decision to stay outside.

The message? Get to know God now. Do not delay till you find yourself at the end of your life at heaven’s gates and have nothing to show for yourself.
